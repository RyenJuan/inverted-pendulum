# inverted-pendulum
Just an upside down pendulum made with Javascripts Canvas

An inverted pendulum is an unstable pendulum with its mass supported above its pivot. Its dynamics were modeled with a lagrangian and numerically solved to draw onto the canvas. The pendulum bob was stabilized to stay vertical with a PID controller. The goal is to add more UI and other controllers in the future

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
While learning how to use the canvas to create the pendulums movement, I also made some interesting art with particles.
