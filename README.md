# inverted-pendulum
Just an inverted pendulum + controller made with Javascripts Canvas

An inverted pendulum is an unstable pendulum with its mass supported above its pivot. Its dynamics were modeled with a lagrangian and numerically solved to draw onto the canvas. The pendulum bob was stabilized to stay vertical with a PID controller. The goal is to add other controllers in the future.

<h2>Usage</h2>
There are two controls to mess with the pendulum. <br></br>
<ul>
  <li> Holding the left/right arrow keys will push the cart left or right. </li>
  <li> Pressing spacebar will enable or disable the controller, allowing it to freely fall.</li>
</ul>
